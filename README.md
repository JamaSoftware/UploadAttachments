# Upload Attachments via REST API  

Jama is designed to allow for great flexibility of content, making it the ultimate definition of a system of record. While many of our customers are busy tapping away at the keyboard, they are often associating their content with documents, images, graphs, tables, equations, and so much more. External documents and images are referred to as attachments in Jama.

This project is a starting point for users interested in automating the upload and download of attachment files using Jama's RESTful API.  

Please note that these scripts are distributed as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.
